# dat-react-native
> React native app using Dat

The idea is to get it working a react native app connected to Dat.

## Stage 0 (completed)
- Find each missing required dependency of Dat for nodejs and create a fix using react native modules.

## Stage 1 (completed)
- Run an Hypercore feed in react native and store the data in memory or `realm` for a real case.
- Create a swarm using native TCP/UDP connections and make a discovery of the feed through the network.
- Replicate feeds through the network.

## Stage 2 (working)
- Create a demo on top of Dat to show a p2p app working.
